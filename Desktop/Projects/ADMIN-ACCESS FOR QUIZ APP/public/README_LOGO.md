   - Used for: Browser tab icon
   - Can be a smaller version of the logo, optimized for small sizes

- **Favicon size**: 32x32px or 64x64px (square)

## Where the Logo is Used

1. **Landing Page** (`/participant`) - Large logo above the "Forechole" title
2. **Admin Dashboard** - Small logo in the header (desktop only)

## After Adding the Images

Once you've added `logo.png` and `favicon.png` to the `public` folder, the app will automatically use them. No code changes needed!

The logo will appear with animations and proper styling on all pages.

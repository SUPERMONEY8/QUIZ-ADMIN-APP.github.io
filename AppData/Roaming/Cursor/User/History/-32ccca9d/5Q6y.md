# Fix MySQL Tablespace Corruption Issue

## Problem
When you changed the MySQL port from 3306 to 3307 and back, MySQL created corrupted tablespace files (.ibd files) that are preventing tables from being created.

## Solution

### Option 1: Manual Fix (Recommended)

1. **Stop MySQL in XAMPP**
   - Open XAMPP Control Panel
   - Click "Stop" for MySQL

2. **Delete corrupted files**
   - Navigate to: `C:\xampp\mysql\data\grocery_delivery_db\`
   - Delete ALL files in this folder (especially all `.ibd` files)
   - Keep the folder itself, just delete its contents

3. **Restart MySQL**
   - In XAMPP Control Panel, click "Start" for MySQL

4. **Run migrations**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   php artisan migrate
   ```

### Option 2: Recreate Database (If Option 1 doesn't work)

1. **Stop MySQL in XAMPP**

2. **Delete the entire database folder**
   - Navigate to: `C:\xampp\mysql\data\`
   - Delete the entire `grocery_delivery_db` folder

3. **Restart MySQL**

4. **Recreate database and run migrations**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   php artisan migrate
   ```

### Option 3: Use phpMyAdmin

1. Open phpMyAdmin (http://localhost/phpmyadmin)
2. Select `grocery_delivery_db` database
3. Go to "Operations" tab
4. Click "Drop the database (DROP)" to completely remove it
5. Create a new database with the same name
6. Run migrations: `php artisan migrate`

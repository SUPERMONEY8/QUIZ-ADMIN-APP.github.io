# Testing Guide - Supply Chain Management App

## Quick Start - Test Your App

### Method 1: Run the Compiled Executable (Fastest)
If you have a previously compiled version, you can run it directly:

1. **Double-click the executable:**
   - Navigate to: `bin\Debug\net8.0-windows\SupplyChainManagement.exe`
   - Double-click it to run

2. **Or use Command Prompt/PowerShell:**
   ```powershell
   cd "C:\Users\LENOVO\Desktop\Depo\bin\Debug\net8.0-windows"
   .\SupplyChainManagement.exe
   ```

### Method 2: Build and Run (Recommended)
If you need to rebuild the app:

1. **Use the batch file:**
   - Double-click `run.bat` in the project root
   - Or double-click `LAUNCH.bat`

2. **Use PowerShell:**
   ```powershell
   .\run.ps1
   ```

3. **Manual command line:**
   ```powershell
   dotnet restore
   dotnet build
   dotnet run
   ```

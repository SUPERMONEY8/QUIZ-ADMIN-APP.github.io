# Employee Shift Assignment - Office Add-in

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Python (if not already installed)
- Download from: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- During installation, make sure to check "Add Python to PATH"
- Python 3.6 or higher is recommended

### 2. Start the Local Web Server

**Option A: Double-click the batch file (Easiest)**
- Simply double-click `start_server.bat` in this folder
- The server will start automatically

**Option B: Using Command Prompt**
- Open Command Prompt in this directory
- Run: `python server.py`
- Or: `python3 server.py` (if Python 3 is installed separately)

The server will start at `http://localhost:3000`

**Keep the server running** - Do not close the command prompt window while using the add-in!

### 3. Sideload the Add-in into Excel

1. Open Excel
2. Go to **Insert** → **Add-ins** → **My Add-ins**
3. Click **Upload My Add-in**
4. Browse to: `C:\Users\LENOVO\Desktop\خفارة\manifest.xml`
5. Click **Upload**

The add-in should now appear and be ready to use!

## Files Structure

- `manifest.xml` - Add-in metadata and configuration
- `taskpane.html` - User interface
- `taskpane.js` - Main application logic
- `taskpane.css` - Styling
- `config.js` - Sheet configuration
- `server.py` - Python web server (for development)
- `start_server.bat` - Windows batch file to start server easily

## Troubleshooting

- **Add-in won't load**: Make sure the server is running at `http://localhost:3000`
- **Path issues**: The manifest.xml uses `http://localhost:3000` - make sure the server is running
- **File not found errors**: Ensure all files are in the same directory as `server.js`

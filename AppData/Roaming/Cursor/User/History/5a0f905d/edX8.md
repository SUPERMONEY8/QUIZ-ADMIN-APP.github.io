# GitHub Push Commands

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `Enjoyed` (or any name you want)
3. Make it **Public** or **Private** (your choice)
4. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
5. Click **"Create repository"**

## Step 2: Copy Your Repository URL
After creating, GitHub will show you the URL. It will look like:
- `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Enjoyed.git`

## Step 3: Run These Commands (I'll do this for you once you provide the URL)

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Enjoyed.git
git push -u origin main
```

---

**OR** if you want to do it yourself, replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `Enjoyed` with your actual values and run:

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\LENOVO\Desktop\Projects\Enjoyed"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
git push -u origin main
```
